# Kalaha-ai

## Inspiration
Driven by the digital divide and prevalence of misinformation in Africa, especially regarding health, we envisioned Kalaha - culturally-sensitive chatbots delivering accurate and accessible health education.
## What it does
Kalaha empowers Kenyans with readily available health information through interactive chatbots. These chatbots understand and respond in local languages, addressing specific health concerns with culturally relevant messages. They integrate with popular messaging platforms like WhatsApp for easy access.
## How we built it
Leveraging pre-trained language models and collaborating with public health experts, we developed Kalaha's core functionalities. We focused on building a user-friendly interface and integrating with popular messaging platforms.
## Challenges we ran into
Language Nuances: Ensuring accurate and culturally appropriate communication across diverse Kenyan languages proved challenging.

Limited Data: Gathering culturally relevant health information in local languages presented a hurdle.
Technical Constraints: Integrating the chatbot with different messaging platforms required technical adaptations.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Importance of Collaboration: Combining technical expertise with public health knowledge was crucial for creating effective chatbots.


## What we learned
Importance of Collaboration: Combining technical expertise with public health knowledge was crucial for creating effective chatbots.
Adaptability in Design: We learned the importance of adapting our approach based on specific cultural contexts.
Continuous Learning: Developing culturally-sensitive chatbots is an ongoing process that requires continuous learning and improvement.


## What's next for Kalaha
Expanding Languages: We aim to incorporate additional Kenyan languages for wider reach.
Enhanced Content Development: Partnering with health organizations to develop a comprehensive health information library for Kalaha.
User Testing and Feedback: Gathering user feedback through pilot testing to refine Kalaha's functionalities and content.
